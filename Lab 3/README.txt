We compiled all our assembly code into one file, assembly_code.s,
and ran it throught the assembler we wrote in python (based on the
discussion section code) to create the machineCode.txt file. This just
requires that the assembly file is in the same directory as the
assembler.

The top_level design is based on all our previous code from lab2
(with some minor adjustments) as well as some new files (controll.sv,
the mux files, etc.). All the additional code is found in the Code folder.
