# CSE141L: Project in Computer Architecture

Project Overview: 

	Lab 1: Design an instruction set and instruction forms for my own 9-bit processor. Coded two assembly programs, string match and long division, to run on my processor. For a full lab description see Lab1.pdf

	Lab 2: Design the register file, ALU, fetch unit (program counter and instruction memory), and data memory for my CPU. For a full lab description see Lab 2.docx

	Lab 3: Connected all components from Lab 2 together, designed logic and muxes for each component so all instructions work properly

	Lab 4: Test and debug code written in Lab 1 on finally processor from Lab 3 to verify the output is correct and the processor works as intended
